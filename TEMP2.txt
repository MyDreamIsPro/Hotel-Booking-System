/users/authenticate - public route that accepts HTTP POST requests containing a username and password 
    in the body. If the username and password are correct then a JWT authentication token and the user 
    details are returned in the response body, and a refresh token cookie (HTTP Only) is returned in the 
    response headers.

/users/refresh-token - public route that accepts HTTP POST requests with a refresh token cookie. 
    If the cookie exists and the refresh token is valid then a new JWT authentication token and the 
    user details are returned in the response body, a new refresh token cookie (HTTP Only) is returned 
    in the response headers and the old refresh token is revoked.

/users/revoke-token - secure route that accepts HTTP POST requests containing a refresh token either 
    in the body or in a cookie, if both are present the token in the body is used. If the refresh token 
    is valid and active then it is revoked and can no longer be used to refresh JWT tokens.

/users - secure route that accepts HTTP GET requests and returns a list of all the users in the 
    application if the HTTP Authorization header contains a valid JWT token. If there is no auth 
    token or the token is invalid then a 401 Unauthorized response is returned.

/users/{id} - secure route that accepts HTTP GET requests and returns the details of the user with 
    the specified id.

/users/{id}/refresh-tokens - secure route that accepts HTTP GET requests and returns a list of all 
    refresh tokens (active and revoked) of the user with the specified id.
